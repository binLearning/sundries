[Chinese Whispers - an Efficient Graph Clustering Algorithm and its Application to Natural Language Processing Problems](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/3e71/0251cb01ba6e1c0c735591776a212edc461f.pdf) <br>

Chinese Whispers (CW) is a very basic – yet effective – algorithm to partition the nodes of weighted, undirected graphs. 
It is motivated by the eponymous children’s game, where children whisper words to each other. While the game’s goal is 
to arrive at some funny derivative of the original message by passing it through several noisy channels, the CW algorithm
aims at finding groups of nodes that broadcast the same message to their neighbors.  <br>
